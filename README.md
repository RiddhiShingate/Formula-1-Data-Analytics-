# Formula-1-Data-Analytics-

Formula 1 (F1) is a global motorsport that combines advanced engineering with high-speed racing. It generates vast amounts of data, including race times, driver performance, team strategies, weather conditions and circuit details. Analyzing this data helps teams improve strategies, optimize performance and understand race dynamics. This project uses technologies like PySpark, SparkSQL, Cloud, Tableau and Machine Learning to analyze and predict F1 race ranks. The main objective is Data Processing using PySQL and PySpark to efficiently handle large datasets for analysis and model training. Predictive Models: Developing machine learning models to forecast race results and identify key performance factors Data Insights Analyzing F1 data to uncover important elements influencing race outcomes. Visualizations: Creating user-friendly dashboards in Tableau to present insights Machine Learning algorithms are used to study historical race data and predict results.
